<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    Formerly the IEEE Neural Network Council, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society focuses on the theory, design, application,
    and development of nature- and brain-inspired knowledge representation and computational paradigms together with learning and artificially
    intelligent systems in which these paradigms are contained.

<p>
    IEEE CIS emphasizes the study and application of: Neural networks, Evolutionary algorithms, Swarm intelligence algorithms, Fuzzy and
    rule-based systems, and Cognitive systems. Furthermore, Computational Intelligence (CI), often another name for Artificial Intelligence,
    is the theory, design, application and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms. Traditionally
    the three main pillars of CI have been Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Evolutionary Computation.

    The IEEE CIS Student Branch Chapter is affiliated to the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Puerto Rico
    at Mayag√ºez. Our mission is to further mathematics, science, and computing education in emerging fields within Artificial Intelligence
    in our campus.
